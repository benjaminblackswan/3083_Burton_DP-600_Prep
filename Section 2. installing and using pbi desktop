## Practice Activity 1

It's time for your first Practice Activity.

    If you haven't already downloaded the workbook "FabricData", please do so. It is included in the zipped file from the Resources lecture in Section 1 of this course.

    Open up Power BI, and in a new Power BI file use this workbook to "Get Data" from the spreadsheet "DimGeography".

    Create a stacked column chart and resize it so that it fills the page.

    With that new visual selected, drag the column EnglishCountryRegionName (in the DimGeography table) from the Data pane to the X-axis and the Y-axis in the Build pane.

    Save this page to your local hard drive, and publish it to the Power BI service.

Good luck. If you get stuck, then please watch the next video, when I will do this Practice Activity as well.
